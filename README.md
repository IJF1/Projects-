# Personal Projects
This repository showcases my journey through hands-on engineering, home renovation, automotive maintenance, and creative builds. What began with helping my family renovate our home has grown into a wide range of projects — from building Marvel-inspired replicas and functional props to working on cars and designing a mini wind tunnel to study aerodynamics. Each project has pushed me to learn new skills, experiment with ideas, and apply both creativity and engineering thinking.
